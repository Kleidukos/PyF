## Difference

- Exponential formater *e* and *E* formats the exponent with less digits. For example `0.2` formatted as `.1e` gives `2.0e-1` instead of `2.0e-01`.
- Centering puts more char on the right than on the left. For example `hello` formatted as `+10s` gives `+++hello++` instead of `++hello+++`.
